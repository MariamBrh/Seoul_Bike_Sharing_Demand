Seoul is a city spread over more than 600 km2, six times the size of Paris. It is necessary to take precautions when it comes to traveling, especially at peak hours, which generate end less traffic jams in the city's streets.

Paris has its "v√©lib'" and, for a few years now, Seoul has its equivalent the "Ddareungi". Bicycles, which were not very visible until a few years ago, are now widely used in the South Korean capital and even in other provincial cities.

In this report we will study the bicycle **rental data** in Seoul for the year 2018. The objective of our analysis is to discover the factor(s) that determine the demand for self-service bicycle rentals, build statistical models and then try to make rental prediction based on the information and models available to us. Our data mining and analysis will be done in Python.

## This project is implemented in Python and gathers tasks of :  
* Data visualisation : show correlations between the data and the target on the Jupyter Notebook
* Machine learning algorithm modelisation on the Jupyter Notebook
* Transformation of the model into an API Django
  
 
## This repositery contains:
* The Jupyter Notebook file
* Slides report of the analysis
* The Realease of the model within an API

## Conclusion : 
This study shows that the rents of bikes are influenced by a lot of features. In this study, we understood that many koreans usually and mainly rent bikes during the week days, so we supposed that the main use is to go to school or work. There are also many conditions which contribute to the variation of number of rents like the the day of the week, the moment of the day and weather conditions. Weather conditions are also very important because there are more rents during spring and summer. And as we expected more people are set to rent bikes when the weather is favorable.   
You can check below the result of the deployment of our Machine Learning model : the extras trees regressor which had the best score among the models.
